## Goals For This Project
I am going to make my project in Unity and I am going to make a Pathfinding system that will find the fasest way to get out from a maze. 

The Path Finding system will be a A* PathFinding system. The Reffrens of this A*star Alogrithm is from: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L-WgKMFuhE

There will be diffrent terrain in the maze and there will be diffrent ways to get out of the maze. 

There will be a way to get out that is short but the terrain makes it really slow and there will be very long ways to get out of the maze but that way would not have rough terrian. After implomenting that I will imploment a system where you will be able to jump over the obstical. There two ways that I am trying to figigure out with one that will be the best after done with the pathfinding.  

The character should also be able to jump two times over the obstical to find the fastest way though the maze. 

I am think of two diffrent systems of the jump mecahnic either jump pads thougt the world where you will be able to jump over the wall. Or that you will just be able to jump where ever there is a wall but just two times.

The jump mecanic will be more lika a teleport where the AI goes upp to the wall and then shows upp on the other side of the wall on the new node.  


This is a System I would like to make, The first secondes of it show what I would like to make: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L-WgKMFuhE
